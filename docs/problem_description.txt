Problem description/Motivation
------------------------------
I am a Formula 1 fan and I was unhappy with my favorite source of news. Their mobile page sometimes shows more then 
66% ads and only 33% content. Additionally sometimes a late ad overlay caught my intent of clicking a news item and
directed me the another ad page. Their Android app is slow and shows a loading overlay after every click. Having a bad
network reception on my daily commute made it hard to read the news.

My idea was to write an RSS reader which loads their rss feed. After the list is updated, all articles will be 
downloaded, parsed and stored into a database in the background. This way I am able to prefetch the articles where I 
have reception and use the app without delays (even in airplane mode).

In order to comply with Udacity's Term's of licence (I don't have rights for the real RSS Feed), no real content is 
downloaded. Instead of loading a real RSS Feed a new news item will be created randomly on startup and when returning to the
list from a detail view.
